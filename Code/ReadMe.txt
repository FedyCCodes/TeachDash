TeachDash setup for the application

1) Libraries and External Downloads:
  i) Go to node js website and download the LTS version from https://nodejs.org/en/
  ii) Once you've installed it, set it up on your computer and make sure it works

2) Setting up the project:
  i) once you have node js ready, write in the terminal "cd " (with the space, DO NOT CLICK ENTER YET)
  ii) then drag and drop the folder of the project ("TeachDash-Electron") into the terminal
  iii) Now click enter
  iv) Now we have to download the node modules for it to work so you will need to type "npm install" then enter (don't close the terminal)

3) Build or direct run:
  i) You can either build the project to your Operating System or run the development version
  ii) to build:
    a) In the terminal write "npm run make" and enter, this will create the a folder named "out" with an executable of the project
  iii) to run:
    a) if you would prefer just directly running the project without building it as an executable, write "npm start" and then the project will open up.
